## Description

A common table expression (CTE) defines a temporary result set that a user can reference possibly multiple times within the scope of a SQL statement. A CTE is used mainly in a SELECT statement.

## Syntax

```sql
WITH common_table_expression [ , ... ]
```

While `common_table_expression` is defined as

```sql
expression_name [ ( column_name [ , ... ] ) ] [ AS ] ( query )
```

## Parameters

* **expression_name**

  Specifies a name for the common table expression.

* **query**

  A [SELECT statement](/user-guide/querying/query-syntax/data-retrieval/select).

## Examples

```sql
-- CTE with multiple column aliases
WITH t(x, y) AS (SELECT 1, 2)
SELECT * FROM t WHERE x = 1 AND y = 2;
+---+---+
| x | y |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+

-- CTE in CTE definition
WITH t AS (
WITH t2 AS (SELECT 1)
  SELECT * FROM t2
)
SELECT * FROM t;
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+

-- CTE in subquery
SELECT max(c) FROM (
WITH t(c) AS (SELECT 1)
  SELECT * FROM t
);
+------+
|max(c)|
+------+
| 1    |
+------+

-- CTE in subquery expression
SELECT (
WITH t AS (SELECT 1)
  SELECT * FROM t
);
+----------------+
|scalarsubquery()|
+----------------+
| 1              |
+----------------+

-- CTE in CREATE VIEW statement
CREATE VIEW v AS
WITH t(a, b, c, d) AS (SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4)
SELECT * FROM t;
SELECT * FROM v;
+---+---+---+---+
| a | b | c | d |
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+

-- If name conflict is detected in nested CTE, then AnalysisException is thrown by default.
-- SET spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedencePolicy = CORRECTED (which is recommended),
-- inner CTE definitions take precedence over outer definitions.
SET spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedencePolicy = CORRECTED;
WITH
t AS (SELECT 1),
t2 AS (
  WITH t AS (SELECT 2)
  SELECT * FROM t
)
SELECT * FROM t2;
+---+
| 2 |

| 2 |
